# Type Error in TypeScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `add` function is defined to accept two number arguments, but it is called with a string and a number. This results in a type error during compilation.

The solution demonstrates how to fix the type error using type guards or by ensuring that the function is called with the correct types of arguments.
